RESTful module is a new approach to providing a REST server in Drupal. Its concepts and philoshopy apepars in the module's README, but I'd like to go over some of the points and show example.
In the past year almost every site we have is either completely decoupled from the server side where AngularJs serves the webapp, or AngularJS plays a smaller part, and we just embed web components inside a Drupal page, to provide a slick UI.
